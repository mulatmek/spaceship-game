# Spaceship Battle Game
This is a 2-player spaceship battle game built with Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to shoot down your opponent's spaceship while avoiding their bullets. The first player to run out of health loses the game.

## Game Overview
Each player controls a spaceship, which can be moved up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys or WASD keys. Players can shoot bullets at each other using the spacebar or the left mouse button.
